"""Validator for craftsperson/rust/compile-public-documentation.

Every pub item in the library carries a doc comment, or is a module documented
by its own //! header, so rustdoc has nothing undocumented to report.

A thin entry point: the check itself lives in ../lib/adherence/checks.py and
the invocation protocol in ../README.md.
