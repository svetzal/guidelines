"""Validator for craftsperson/python/graceful-async-timeouts-and-cancellation.

An explicit timeout bounds every configured awaited operation, and no handler
catches `CancelledError` or a bare exception without re-raising it.

A thin entry point: the check itself lives in ../lib/adherence/checks.py and
the invocation protocol in ../README.md.
